# Ethers Tools Test Results
Date: 2024-03-19

## Network Support
✅ `getSupportedNetworks` - WORKING
- Successfully returns list of supported networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.
- Each network includes chainId and currency information
- Note: No default network is set (all isDefault: false)

## Wallet Operations
### Generate Wallet
✅ `generateWallet` - WORKING
- Successfully generates new wallet address and private key
- Saves to environment when specified

### Check Wallet
❌ `checkWalletExists` - NOT WORKING
- Returns API key error when provider specified
- Issue: Appears to require API key configuration

### Load Wallet
✅ `loadWallet` - WORKING
- Successfully loads wallet from private key
- Confirms wallet address matches generated wallet
- Saves to environment when specified

### Sign Data
✅ `ethSign` - WORKING
- Successfully signs data using eth_sign
- Returns valid signature
- Includes appropriate security warning about legacy method

### Wallet Balance
❌ `getWalletBalance` - NOT WORKING
- Returns 403 Forbidden error
- Issue: Alchemy API hardcoded demo key is being used (`_gg7wSSi0KMBsdKnGVfHDueq6xMB9EkC`)
- Solution: Need to properly implement ethers default provider fallback

### Transaction Count
❌ `getWalletTransactionCount` - NOT WORKING
- Returns 403 Forbidden error
- Issue: Alchemy API hardcoded demo key is being used
- Solution: Same as wallet balance fix

## Testing Status Summary
The integration tests for actual blockchain interactions are mostly passing, but there are some issues with the unit tests:

1. The failing tests are using Jest-specific mocking functionality (`jest.mock()`) which is not compatible with Bun's test runner
2. Recommended fix: Use test doubles instead of mocks, which aligns with your preference for avoiding mocks

## Implementation Issues Found

1. API Key Configuration:
   - Provider operations are using a hardcoded demo API key: `_gg7wSSi0KMBsdKnGVfHDueq6xMB9EkC`
   - This is causing 403 Forbidden errors due to rate limiting

2. Default Provider Not Used:
   - The code attempts to use Alchemy first but doesn't properly fall back to ethers default provider
   - We've implemented fixes to use ethers' default provider as a fallback

3. Test Framework Compatibility:
   - Some unit tests are written with Jest's mocking API, but tests are run with Bun
   - Bun doesn't support Jest's `jest.mock()` functionality

## Configuration Requirements:
- Valid API key needed for provider operations
- Environment persistence only lasts for current session
- Alternative provider options should be considered

## Recommendations:
1. Fix default provider fallback implementation
2. Convert mocking-based tests to use test doubles
3. Set up proper environment variable handling for API keys
4. Add provider status check before operations
5. Create comprehensive tests for all API tools

## Next Steps:
1. Implement the testing approach recommended in test-fixes.md
2. Fix provider initialization to properly use fallbacks
3. Complete testing of remaining tools with working provider

## Testing Plan for Remaining Functions:
1. Block Operations:
   - getBlockNumber
   - getBlockDetails
   - getTransactionDetails

2. Network Operations:
   - getGasPrice
   - getFeeData

3. Contract Operations:
   - getContractCode

4. ENS Operations:
   - lookupAddress
   - resolveName

5. Unit Conversion:
   - formatEther
   - parseEther
   - formatUnits

## Issues Found:
1. API Key Configuration:
   - Provider operations require valid API key
   - Current Alchemy API key has exceeded monthly capacity
   - Need new API key or alternative provider configuration

2. Provider Dependencies:
   - Many operations depend on provider access
   - Need to test with multiple providers to ensure reliability

## Configuration Requirements:
- Valid API key needed for provider operations
- Environment persistence only lasts for current session
- Alternative provider options should be considered

## Recommendations:
1. Configure new API key for testing
2. Consider implementing fallback providers
3. Add provider status check before operations
4. Document API key requirements in setup guide

## Next Steps:
1. Test remaining wallet operations
2. Document any additional configuration requirements
3. Test network-specific operations
4. Complete comprehensive function testing

## Configuration Requirements:
- API key needed for provider operations
- Environment persistence only lasts for current session
